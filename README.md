## Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for the Construction of Spanning Structures
Code from the paper ["Reinforcement learning for scaffold free construction of spanning structures"][https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3623263.3623359] adapted for the Semester Project "Reinforcement Learnin from Human Feedback for the Construction of Spanning Structures", taking inspiration from the [imitation library][https://imitation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/].
 
The top level file that runs the RLHF algorithm is called rlhf_main.py. The hyperparameters of the run are all set at the top of this file.
